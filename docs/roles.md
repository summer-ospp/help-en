# The Role in Open Source Promotion Plan

The main roles of the participants are students, communities and mentors.

## Community

The community provides a list and description of the project, arranges a mentor for each project, and ensures that the corresponding process work is carried out according to the program rules.

See [Community Guide](community.md) for details.

## Student

Students are free to choose projects and communicate with mentors on implementation plans in order to write project plans. The selected students will complete the development task as planned and contribute the results to the community under the guidance of the community mentor. Students who successfully complete their projects will receive bonuses and completion certificates.

See [Student Guide](student.md) for details.

## Mentor

The community assigns a mentor for each project, who guides students in developing appropriate development plan and complete the project according to the plan.

See [Mentor Guide](mentor.md) for details.

## Organizing Committee

The organizing committee is composed of staff arranged by the organizer and is responsible for the organization and management of the activities.
