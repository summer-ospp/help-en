# The Role in Open Source Promotion Plan

The main roles of the participants are students, communities and mentors.

## Community

The community provides a list and description of the project, and arranges for a mentor to communicate the program with applicants and select one of the applicants to undertake the project. During the three-month development period, the mentor guides the students in developing the corresponding projects.

See [Community Guide](community.md) for details.

## Student

Students are free to choose projects and communicate with mentors on implementation plans in order to write project plans. The selected students will complete the development task as planned and contribute the results to the community under the guidance of the community mentor. The community evaluates student completion and the organizer committee grants the money award to students based on the evaluation results.

See [Student Guide](student.md) for details.

## Mentor

For each project, the community assigns a mentor to work with the students to develop appropriate plan and guide the students to complete the task as planned.

See [Mentor Guide](mentor.md) for details.

## Organizing Committee

The organizing committee is composed of staff arranged by the organizer and is responsible for the organization and management of the activities.
