Non development open source projects need to adopt [ODI organization certified recommended open knowledge protocol](#odi-organization-approved-and-recommended-open-knowledge-license).

## Whether the project whose license is not approved by OSI will have change to be accepted

The licenses in OSI list and ODI list is suggested.

We understand the OSI list is dynamic, and some licenses is under review. we are open for more type of open source projects. But if the community whose license is not in OSI list or ODI list, organizing committee need to spend more time on investagting and evaluating the commnity.

## Can the community propose development projects for upstream open source software repository

It can be proposed, but the following conditions should be met:

1. The agreement of upstream open source software warehouse should belong to [OSI organization certified open source agreement](https://opensource.org/licenses) Or  [recommended open knowledge protocol certified by ODI organization](#odi-organization-approved-and-recommended-open-knowledge-license).
2. The tutor designated by the community has the ability to guide the students to complete the development work of the corresponding project. For example, the tutor is an active developer in the upstream community.

## What is the bonus of each project

- The difficulty of the project is divided into high, medium and low levels, and the corresponding pre tax bonus is high (12000 RMB), medium (9000 RMB) and low (6000 RMB) (Note: the amount of bonus is pre tax RMB).
- The difficulty level is determined by the community according to the project task.
- The sponsor will fund the projects that students will eventually apply for. Within the budget, the sponsor will support as many projects as possible, which are expected to be more than 1000.

In general, the committee will respect the difficulty setting of the community and the committee will also check the difficulty setting in the community page. If the difficulty setting is not reasonable, it will communicate with the community to adjust the difficulty level.

3. The community needs to appoint a community mentor for each project, which is generally the developer (maintainer, committer, contributor) related to the project. Each mentor can be the mentor of three projects at most at the same time. Please refer to [Mentor guide](mentor.md) for tutor participation, specifically responsible for:
