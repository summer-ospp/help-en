## 3. What can you achieve?

By participating in the OSPP, communities can increase their exposure, expand their brand awareness, and attract outstanding university developers to join their community, bringing new energy to the community and participating in the construction and maintenance of the open source community.

## 4. Participation Processes

**All processes will be operated in the OSPP system.*

### （1）Community Registration

Community liaisons can register a community account and log in to the OSPP system through the community login portal on the official website, fill in community information, and complete community registration.

* If the community liaison is also a mentor, please use a different email address to register for the system. 
* Communities that already have an account should use their original account to log in.
* The community liaison will serve as the communication bridge between the organizing committee and the community, coordinating and promoting related matters.
* The information provided by the community liaison must be valid to avoid registration failure due to inaccurate information.

### （2）Project Release

**PROJECT INSTRUCTIONS**

**A. Number of Projects**

* Before the Project Release (April 4, UTC+8), the organizing committee will determine the number of projects it can support (represented by X) based on community registration and previous program information, and inform the community. 
* During the Project Release phase, the community can submit in the system based on their needs(the number of projects is not limited). Approved projects will be gradually published on the official website. 
* During the Community Review phase (see section 4. Community Review), the community will discuss and determine the approved projects. If the number of projects approved by the community is less than or equal to X, then all projects are supported by the organizing committee. If the number of projects approved by the community is more than X, the community needs to indicate in the system which projects are supported by the organizing committee and which are community-supported. The community needs to sign a community cooperation agreement with the organizing committee for community-supported projects. See section 5. Community-Supported Projects for details.
 
 **B. Project Types**

* OSPP prioritizes development projects and considers various projects that benefit community development. For example, functional tasks, such as adding one or more important features to the community's open-source project (not limited to this); optimization tasks, such as improving speed, reducing resource consumption, and improving performance (not limited to this), etc.
* It is recommended that projects participating in the program have been open source and publicly operated for at least six months. 
    
  *This year's OSPP focuses on supporting RISC-V and basic software related projects.

**C. Difficulty and Bonus**

* **Advanced level**: 
  * Students who complete the project will receive a pre-tax bonus of RMB 12,000
  
* **Basic level**: 
  * Students who complete the project will receive a pre-tax bonus of RMB 8,000
 
i. The difficulty setting of the project should be based on project requirements, technical thresholds, and estimated project development workloads. 

ii. The key criterion for project review is that the student's contribution code must be merged into the community project repository (published on the official website) in the form of a PR/MR.

iii. After the project development, there is a one-month period for project PR/MR merging.

iv. Reference Example :

* **Basic level**:

v. Project Bonus Sources: The organizing committee-supported project's bonus will be provided by the organizing committee, while the community will provide the community-supported project's bonus.

### （3）Designated Mentor

* The community needs to appoint a mentor for each project, who should generally be a developer (Maintainer, Committer, Contributor) of that project. Each mentor can only guide one project.
* The community account selects the mentor when publishing the project in the system. If the mentor information is not included in the system, the mentor's account information needs to be added.
* One can only participate in activities as mentor or student. Otherwise, the bonus will be canceled.

### （4）Community Review

The OSPP adds a community review process during the student project application review phase. Only students who have been approved by the mentor, community and organizing committee can be recognized as selected students for the project.

* The community accounts can view the application and status of the community's projects in the system. 
* **The quality of the project application is the main criterion for evaluating whether the student's application is approved.**
* The community review will be conducted after the mentor review. Before the community review, the community should communicate with the mentor and student, understand the project application and review status, organize internal discussions within the community, and determine the final community-approved project application among the applications approved by the mentor. The number of projects approved by the community review should not exceed the number of supported projects X informed by the organizing committee. 
* If the community wants to increase the number of projects approved, they should sign a community cooperation agreement with the organizing committee and add it as a community-supported project (see section 5 below). 
* The community review process should be operated in a community account.

### （5）Community-Supported Projects

If the number of projects approved by the community review exceeds the number of organizing committee-supported projects X, the community needs to sign a community cooperation agreement with the organizing committee and increase it as a community-supported project. The bonus and tax of community-supported projects will be provided by the community. 

* Before the accepted students are announced, the community should sign the community cooperation agreement ( Community Cooperation Agreement - Template), which should specify the number, name, difficulty, and bonus amount of the community-supported projects. 
* The community provides funds for the designated project's bonus, which will be used in full to pay the bonus and taxes for the designated project. The community does not need to pay the support funds if the supported project is not completed. The actual amount of community support will be based on the "Community Completion Project List" issued by the organizing committee after the final review. 
* The community-supported project will be marked with a special symbol in the community and project list.

### （6）Community Responsibilities

* The community should launch an OSPP page on the community's official website or public repository of the project. The page content should include a project list, project details, and related reference materials. The format (HTML, Wiki, etc.) is not limited. 
* Before the community review, the community should communicate with mentors and students to understand the project application and mentor review process, jointly determine the students and projects that pass the review and complete the community review before the deadline.
* If the community wants to support projects, they should sign a community cooperation agreement with the organizing committee before the accepted students are announced.
* During the bonding period, the community should organize communication for mentors and students.
* The community should provide corresponding assistance during the project development period, and coordinate and solve problems encountered by students and mentors in the development process.
* If the community needs to change account information, modify community introductions, project descriptions, or change mentors, please send an application email to [org@summer-ospp.ac.cn](mailto:org@summer-ospp.ac.cn) and submit an information modification application form. The organizing committee does not recommend modifying relevant information after the announcement, so please carefully check and confirm before publishing.
* Please refer to the mentor guide for mentor responsibilities, which include but are not limited to:

    * Providing project information according to the project template.
    * Communicating with potential applicants, reviewing the project application, and confirming the final selected student.
    * Mentoring students in the development process.
    * Evaluating the student's development results.
