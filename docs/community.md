## Can the community propose development projects for upstream open source software repository

It can be proposed, but the following conditions should be met:

1. The agreement of upstream open source software warehouse should belong to [OSI organization certified open source agreement](https://opensource.org/licenses) Or  [recommended Open Knowledge License](#_10).
2. The tutor designated by the community has the ability to guide the students to complete the development work of the corresponding project. For example, the tutor is an active developer in the upstream community.

## What is the bonus of each project

- The difficulty of the project is divided into high, medium and low levels, and the corresponding pre tax bonus is high (12000 RMB), medium (9000 RMB) and low (6000 RMB) (Note: the amount of bonus is pre tax RMB).
- The difficulty level is determined by the community according to the project task.
- The sponsor will fund the projects that students will eventually apply for. Within the budget, the sponsor will support as many projects as possible, which are expected to be more than 1000.

In general, the committee will respect the difficulty setting of the community and the committee will also check the difficulty setting in the community page. If the difficulty setting is not reasonable, it will communicate with the community to adjust the difficulty level.

## What does the community need to do after signing up for the activity

1. The community should launch the "Summer 2021" page (HTML, Wiki, etc.) on the community official website (or project open repository), including the detailed list of all project tasks provided by the community / project team, providing the project task information and corresponding reference materials with the estimated development workload of 3 months.
2. The community should inform the Organizing Committee of the link address after launching the "Summer 2021" page. The organizing committee <https://summer.iscas.ac.cn/> will introduce the information of the community online, and provide links to jump to the activity description page of the community; all project lists will be provided synchronously on the official website of the activity, but subject to the project details on the community page.
3. The community needs to appoint a community mentor for each project, which is generally the developer (maintainer, committer, contributor) related to the project. Each mentor can be the mentor of three projects at most at the same time. Please refer to [Mentor guide](mentor.md) for tutor participation, specifically responsible for:
