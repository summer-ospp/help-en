## Suggestions for students participation

1. Read the information and help provided in this document in detail, and the organizing committee will try our best to write the contents considered in this help document.

2. Confirm your schedule to ensure that you can participate in the project at least 30 hours a week.

3. It is vital to devote the open source project with personal initiative. We hope that students can find solutions by themselves before contacting us. At least read the student guide, key issues as well as activity agenda, etc.

4. Before participating in open source projects, please sort out your professional skills, interested technologies, interested programming languages, etc., which are conducive to the selection of appropriate projects.

5. Carefully check the community's documents, not only the list of projects provided by the community, but also be familiar with the community's participation methods, communication channels, community software design documents and community open source repository, etc.

6. Focusing on 1-2 communities of interest, applying for multiple communities will reduce the probability of being selected.

7. Carefully prepare the project application. No matter which school or major you come from, the quality of the project application is the main factor to be selected.

8. Read the requirements of the application carefully to ensure that the application materials submitted meet the requirements of the organizing committee, including project application, identity certificate, etc.

9. The order of application will not affect whether it is selected or not. The organizing committee will sort out the application materials together after the deadline and transfer them to the corresponding community for review.

10. However, please do not submit on the last day to avoid not being familiar with the application process, such as lack of application materials, network and other problems, resulting in unable to complete the application within the specified time. The organizing committee will collect applications in strict accordance with the deadline, and applications submitted late will not be accepted.

11. Students should abide by the relevant norms of the corresponding community to contribute to the development.

## How can the students communicate with community mentors

Students can enter into the project list of each community through the official website page of the activity. There will be a designated mentor name and e-mail in each project description. It is suggested that students communicate with tutors through e-mail. E-mail is also the basic way to participate in the community.

Please pay attention to the basic etiquette of communication with the tutor. The mentor only provides guidance and suggestions withintheir  capability. The application, design and development of the project are completed by the students themselves.

## When will the students start project development

After the organizing committee officially announced the selected students.

## Can the selected students develop in advance

Before the organizing committee publishes the list of selected students, the candidates of the funded students of the project are in an uncertain state, and any student's application may be rejected due to other students' better project plan or other reasons.

The organizing committee does not recommend that students start research and development work in advance, instead, should focus on improving the project application and project scheme. Whether it is the project of this activity or the work project in the future, the early project planning and scheme design are very important.

## What kind of support can the selected students gain in the activities

- Professional guidance of community mentors.

- The organizing committee will set up a group of selected students, maintain direct communication with students, and deal with feedback from students in time.

- The organizing committee will provide platform support for project development support, project report and achievement submission. Students should communicate with mentors on how to submit their contributions to and be accepted by the community.

- The organizing committee will award the selected students three times:

  - All the selected students will receive a gift package from the organizing committee, including commemorative T-shirt, USB disk, etc.

  - Students who pass the mid-term assessment will receive 50% of the project bonus first.

  - According to the final project evaluation results, the remaining project bonus will be paid in proportion.

## How to carry out project development for the selected students

After the selected student list is published on the official website, they will be supported by the following platforms:

- Receive the platform account and help provided by the organizing committee.

  - By default, the organizing committee chooses the mailbox used by students to create the platform gitlab account. If students need to modify it, they can contact the organizing committee by email to apply for modification;

  - By default, the Organizing Committee establishes a project repository for each student, in which the code repository and Wiki pages are publicly accessible, and the mentors and students have operation rights. Additionally, the repository contains the following contents:

  - The project repository has the community set license by default;

    - The wiki page provides the project application with hidden student information by default;

    - The code repository used by students in the process of project development can be communicated and determined by the community. It can be stored in the open repository of the designated platform in the community, or in the repository provided by the organizing committee. If students only use the organizing committee repository to submit milestone achievements, they need to publicize the actual repository address in the wiki page;

    - Students need to submit the complete project code to the organizing committee platform warehouse before the milestone node (this requirement is mainly for students whose process output code is not stored in the organizing committee platform), and submit the corresponding report to the corresponding issue (created by the Organizing Committee in advance)
