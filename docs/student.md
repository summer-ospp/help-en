### （3）Participation Process

**All processes will be operated in the OSPP system. The default time zone is UTC+8.*

#### 1. Project Communication

**REGISTRATION**

* Students can register and log in to the OSPP System through the student login portal on the official website, and complete the application by providing the required information as per the program requirements. 
* Previous participants can log in with their original account to update their information and apply.
* The git email submitted by the student in the community repository must be the email used for registration.
* Students cannot participate in the program as a mentor at the same time. 
  
**CHOOSING THE PROJECTS**

* Students can view the [Project List](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/#/org) on the official website.
* Students can apply for up to three projects at the same time, but can only undertake one project in the end.
* Each project can only be undertaken by one student at most.
  
**COMMUNICATE WITH MENTORS**

* The official website's project descriptions include the project mentor's name and contact email of the project mentor. Students can communicate with mentors via email.
* It is important to maintain basic etiquette when communicating with mentors. Mentors only provide guidance and advice within their capacity, and the student should complete the project's application, design, and development by themselves.
* This stage is both a period of understanding project details and a time to get familiar with community operations and etiquette.

#### 2. Project Application

**PREPARING APPLICATION MATERIALS**

* Students can download the [Project Application Template](./assets/Project-Application-Template.pdf ) and prepare the required materials.
* The quality of the project application is the most important criterion for the committee to evaluate whether the student's application is approved or not.
* This is the time to understand the project details and to become familiar with the community operation and etiquette.

**SUBMITTING THE APPLICATION**

* Submit the application materials through the OSPP system.
* Each student can apply for up to three projects, but can only undertake one project in the end. 
* When submitting the application, students should rank the selection priority of the projects they have applied for. If a student is selected by multiple projects, the project with the higher priority will take precedence.

#### 3. Accepted student projects announced

* Students can check the project application results on the official website and the OSPP system.

#### 4. Communicating and Bonding

* Accepted students can communicate further with the community and mentors to clarify project requirements, development plans, and time planning to prepare for project development.

#### 5. Project Development and Project Report Submission

* Before the end of the project development (September 30th, UTC+8), students need to submit PR/MR to the above community project repository, upload the Project Report and fill in the PR/MR link in the OSPP system.
* There is a one-month period for the project PR/MR merge (October 1st - October 30th, UTC+8 ). The submitted PR/MR needs to be merged during this period.
* Students should complete the project development independently. Mentors can only guide students to develop a plan, provide relevant recommended document links, guide students on participating in the community, and provide directional suggestions for improving the implementation plan.

Before the announcement, students are not considered selected and therefore the organizing committee does not recommend starting development early. Before the announcement, students should focus on improving their project proposals and plans. Planning and designing projects are essential for this program and future projects in which students may participate in their careers.
