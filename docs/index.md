# Frequently Asked

## What is Open Source Promotion Plan

* Open Source Promotion Plan is a summer program organized by the Open Source Software Supply Chain Promotion Plan of the Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences. It aims to encourage college students to actively participate in developing and maintaining open source software and promote the vigorous development of an excellent open source software community. We have united with domestic and international open source communities to propose project tasks for developing and maintaining the essential open source software. We are open enrollment to college students around the world.
* Students can choose the projects they are interested in to apply and obtain the opportunity of the senior maintainer (community mentor) to guide them. According to the difficulty and completion of the project, participants will also receive a bonus and certificate of completion.

## How to be a mentor?

* The community liaisons will fill in the mentor's information in the system when they submit the projects. Mentors will receive an invitation letter, log in to the system via the link in the email, and then complete the process in the OSPP system.
* Mentors who already have an account can use their original account to log in.

## Can I participate as a mentor and a student at the same time?

No, you can only choose one role to participate in the event.

## Whether the mentor can assist the student in the development process?

Mentors can't guide students to develop through code and can't help students debug projects. Students should complete the project independently. Mentors can guide students to make plans, provide links to relevant recommendation documents, advise students on participating in the community, and provide directional suggestions for improving the implementation scheme.

## Must the code of student contribution be PR/MR merged into the mainline?

Yes, PR/MR merged into the main line is the essential criterion to determine the project closure.

## Where should the final term assessment codes and reports be submitted?

1. During the project development process, students should follow the community requirements and submit codes to the community's repository.
2. Before the end of the project development (9/30, UTC+8), students must submit a PR/MR and upload the final project report to the OSPP system and provide the PR/MR links.

## How does the mentor review whether the student has passed the final-term assessment?

1. The git email that students submit to the community open source repository must be the same email address they use to sign up.
2. The project needs to be submitted to the community open source repository in the form of PR/MR and has been merged.
3. In terms of progress, mentors should consider the actual development situation of students and the difficulty of development tasks to determine whether they align with the project plan's relevant planning.
4. In terms of results, the tutor should confirm that the final results submitted by the students meet the project's objectives.

## How to become a cooperative partner?

As long as it supports this open source program, whether it's companies, research institutes, universities, or other organizations, we welcome you to be our partners in promoting this program. We also hope to establish a long-term cooperative relationship to promote the development of domestic open source ecology.
