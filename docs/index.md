# Frequently Asked

## What is OSPP

- Open Source Promotion Plan is a summer program organized by the Open Source Software Supply Chain Promotion Plan of the Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences. It aims to encourage college students to actively participate in developing and maintaining open source software and promote the vigorous development of an excellent open source software community. We have united with domestic and international open source communities to propose project tasks for developing and maintaining the essential open source software. We are open enrollment to college students around the world.
- Students can choose the projects they are interested in to apply and obtain the opportunity of the senior maintainer (community mentor) to guide them. According to the difficulty and completion of the project, participants will also receive a bonus and certificate of completion.
- For information on previous events, please refer to the [previous program](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/2023/).

*All processes will be operated in the system, with the default time zone set to Beijing Time (UTC+8).*

## Student Contributors

### Student Eligibility

This program is for college students over 18 years old. Please refer to the [Student Guide](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/help/en/student/) for specific conditions.

### Can I participate as both a mentor and a student?

No, you can only choose one role to participate in the program. If this situation is discovered during the program, the committee will cancel their eligibility, mentor bonus, and student bonus.

### How to apply for projects?

- Student registration is open from April 30 to June 4.
- All processes should be operated in the management system.
- For detailed information, please refer to the [Student Guide](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/help/en/student/).

### What is the project bonus?

- Project difficulty is divided into basic and advanced, and the corresponding student bonus is 8000 RMB before tax and 12000 RMB before tax. (Note: All bonus amounts are pre-tax amounts in RMB).
- Project difficulty will be set based on factors such as project requirements, project scope, technical difficulty, estimated project development workload, and resource limitations.
- Students who pass the final review will receive the bonus.

### If a mentor selects me as the chosen student, can I start development early?

After the committee officially announces the accepted students, they can begin project development. The results are finalized only after matching the rankings of students and mentors and being approved by the community and committee. Before the announcement, the project selection is not confirmed. Mentors are not allowed to pre-select students, make unofficial promises, or ask students to start development work in advance. Any development or PR/MR submissions made before the announcement will not meet the project evaluation timeline requirements and will not be recognized. 

For more detailed information, please refer to the [Student Guide](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/help/en/student/).

## Community

### Which communities can apply to participate?

- Open source community repositories should adopt [OSI organization approved open source license](https://opensource.org/licenses) or [OKF recommended Open Knowledge License](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/help/en/community/##_7).
- Open source communities should have been publicly operational for at least six months.

### How does the community sign up?

- Community registration is open from March 11 to March 31.
- All processes should be operated in the management system (accessed through the official website).
- For detailed information, please refer to the [Community Guide](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/help/en/community/).

### What kind of projects are supported?

OSPP prioritizes development projects while also considering various projects that benefit community development. In principle, the proportion of documentation and front-end projects should not exceed 5% of the total number of projects. It is recommended that projects that have been open-source and publicly operational for at least six months participate in the activity.

For more details, please refer to the Community Guide.

### Which communities can apply to participate?

- This program is open to open source communities whose repository adopts[ OSI organization approved open source license](https://opensource.org/licenses) or [OKF recommended Open Knowledge License](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/help/en/community/##_7).
- Communities committed to promoting open source are welcome to contact the committee to discuss the event promotion and cooperation.

### How does the community sign up?

- Please register, apply for the program, and release projects in the OSPP System.
- For detailed information, please refer to the [Community Guide](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/help/en/community/).

### What kind of projects are supported?

- OSPP encourages and prioritizes development projects, focusing on fundamental software projects such as operating systems, compilers, and key projects related to the RISC-V ecosystem. In principle, the number of documentation and front-end projects should not exceed 5% of the total number of projects. Projects that have been open source and publicly operational for over six months are recommended to participate. 
- For detailed information, please refer to the [Community Guide](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/help/en/community/).

## Project Mentor

### How to be a mentor?

- Project mentors are recommended by the community. When the community liaison adds mentor information to the system, the system will send an invitation email to the mentor. The mentor can click the link in the email to log in to the system for identity verification.
- Mentors who already have an account can use their original account to log in and complete identity verification.
- Mentors cannot participate in this program as both mentors and students. If this is discovered during the program, the committee will cancel their eligibility for participation, mentor bonus, and student bonus.

### Can mentors assist students in development?

Mentors can't guide students to develop through code and can't help students debug projects. Students should complete the project independently. Mentors can guide students to make plans, provide links to relevant recommendation documents, advise students on participating in the community, and provide directional suggestions for improving the implementation scheme.

### Can mentors pre-select students or allow students to start development early?

The project selection results are finalized only after student rankings and mentor rankings are matched and approved by the community and organizing committee. Until the organizing committee announces the selected students, the project selection remains uncertain. Therefore, mentors are not allowed to pre-select students, make private commitments to students regarding selection outcomes, or require students to start development work early. Any development or PR/MR links submitted before the announcement will not meet the project completion review time requirements and will not be recognized.

For more detailed information, please refer to the [Mentor Guide](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/help/en/mentor/).

## Project Development

### Must student-contributed code be merged into the community repository in the form of PR/MR?

Yes, PR/MR merged into the main line is the essential criterion to determine the project closure.

### Where should the final term assessment codes and reports be submitted?

1. During the project development process, students should follow the community requirements and submit codes to the community's repository.
2. Before the end of project development (9/30, UTC+8), students must submit PR/MR and upload the final project report to the OSPP system, and provide the PR/MR links.

### Project Review Criteria

1. **The project needs to be submitted to the open-source community repository in the form of PR/MR and merged.**
2. In terms of progress, mentors should consider the actual development situation of students and the difficulty of development tasks to determine whether they align with the project plan's relevant planning.
3. In terms of results, the tutor should confirm that the final results submitted by the students meet the project's objectives.
4. All PR/MR must be completed by the student within the specified time. The git email used by the student for submissions in the community repository must match the email used during registration.

For detailed project review criteria requirements, please refer to the [Student Guide](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/help/en/student/) and [Mentor Guide](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/help/en/mentor/).
